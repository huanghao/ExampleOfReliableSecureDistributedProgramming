    algo 5.1

    A process floods the system with all proposals it has seen in previous
    rounds. When a process receives a proposal set from another process, it
    merges this set with its own.

    A process decides when it has reached a round during which it has gathered
    all proposals that will ever possibly be seen by any correct process. At
    the end of this round, the process decides a specific value in its proposal
    set.

    A round terminates at a process p when p has received a message from every
    process that has not been detected to have crashed by p in that round.

    In every round, O(N^2) messages are exchanged and O(N^2) DECIDED messages
    are also exchanged after a process has decided. For each additional round
    where a process crashes, another O(N^2) message exchanges occur. In the
    worst case, the algorithm uses O(N^3) messages.

    Uniform agreement: No two processes decide differently, whether they are

    None of the consensus algorithms we presented so far ensure uniform

    too early, without making sure that their decision has been seen by enough
    processes. Should such an early deciding process crash, other processes
    might have no choice but to decide a different value.

    This algorithm always runs for N rounds and every process decides only in
    round N. Intuitively, this permits that one process crashes in every round.

    Algorithm 5.4

    Every process maintaines a single proposal value that it broadcasts in the
    round corresponding to its rank. When it receives a proposal from a more
    importantly ranked process, it adopts the value.

    In every round of the algorithm, the process whose rank corresponds to the
    number of the round is the leader. A round consists of two communication
    steps: within the same round, the leader broadcast a PROPOSAL message to
    all processes, trying to impose its value, and then expects to obtain an
    ACK from all corret processes. Processes that receive a proposal from the
    leader of the round adopt this proposal as their own and send an ACK back
    to the leader of the round. If the leader succeeds in collecting an ACK
    from all processes expect those that P has detected to have crashed, the
    leader can decide. It disseminates the decided value using a reliable
    broadcast communication abstraction.

    if the leader of a round fails, the correct processes detect this and
    proceed to the next round. The leader of the next round is the process
    immediately below the current leader in hierarchy;the new leader broadcases
    its proposal only if it has not already delivered the decision through the
    reliable broadcast abstraction.

    Note that if the leader failes after disseminating the decision, the
    reliable broadcast abstraction ensures that if any process decides and
    stops taking any leadership action then all correct processes will also
    decide.

    Performance: if there are no failures, the algorithm terminates in three
    communication steps: two steps for the first round and one step for the
    reliable broadcast. The algorithm exchanges O(N) messages. Each failure
    of a leader adds two additional communication steps and O(N) additional
    messages.
